\label{chap:discussion}

The results you have collected and the process you when through to develop the project have been presented earlier.  This Chapter is used to talk about your interpretations of results or the process. It might be a discussion of the language you used.  A tool that you started to use but then stopped using for some reason.  It could give insight into the evolution of your process.

\section{Limitations of AC2F}
* If a user finishes a distractor right before they reach a point they wish to go to, then decide to turn 180 degrees virtually and walk back they will have to trigger another distractor or reset. Could be annoying
   * In general, the current position sample heuristic works well enough as a generic heuristic, but more predictive ones would likely work better. 
   
\section{Salience and Distraction}
* Looking at the paper that mentioned salience distribution has effect on focus and attention
   * The bright glowing mushrooms in the environment which are meant to provide some scene illumination might have an effect 
   * Even then, in night time scenes it should probably be somewhat expected to see various salient elements
      * For the sake of lighting and such
   * Further studies into strength of distraction could be interesting in the context of RDW
