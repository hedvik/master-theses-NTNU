\chapter*{Preface}
This is a master's thesis in Applied Computer Science which has been written at NTNU Gj√∏vik during the spring semester of 2019. The project topic came as a result of wanting to apply a prior background of game programming to a field of VR research. Redirected walking was eventually chosen as it consisted of a sub-field of research on distractors which are a perfect fit for VR games that employ redirected walking. This has hopefully provided a more practical and applied perspective to a field of research that otherwise still primarily exists in the theoretical space where smaller technical demos are the largest extent of implementation.  

The target audience for this thesis is primarily masters level students in applied computer science and game developers who have an interest in redirected walking. As such, some basic knowledge of how computer games function is expected. Any additional background will be provided for more detailed and specific topics which may not be considered as general knowledge for the target audience.\\[2cm]
