\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Redirection Adaptability}
* Will probably be relevant to discuss
* Boelling et al. mentions there is some adaptivity effect at least for curvature gains. They would expect this to be true for other gains as well
* Do we see an adaptivity effect or not?
   * If no, it is likely that the alignment phases during AC2F limit adaptivity effects as gains are disabled at those times.
* The estimation method may play a role
* At the same time, once aligned AC2F disables gains completely, allowing the user to get used to normal head rotations again. This could counteract adaptivity effects

\subsection{Individual detection thresholds}
* Might be relevant to discuss
* Creating calibrating scenarios in software that allows users to estimate their own thresholds
