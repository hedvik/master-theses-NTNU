\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I want to give special thanks to my supervisors: Simon and Christopher, for their excellent feedback throughout the semester. Their insights and comments have been a great help in reflecting on my work. 
Furthermore, I would like to thank all of the participants who spent their time to partake in my experiments. Their contributions have provided many interesting results which I could not have achieved otherwise. 
Finally, I would like to give my thanks to Yijie Zhou for allowing to reuse some of his 3D assets. They have been a great contributor in making Ensemble Retriever look as visually appealing as it does.
